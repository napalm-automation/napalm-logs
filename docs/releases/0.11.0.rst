.. _release-0.11.0:

==============================
Release 0.11.0 - Codename Rasp
==============================

Support for Python 3.6 and earlier versions has been dropped, and similarly 
ZeroMQ 2 is no longer supported. Please upgrade your environment and 
dependencies to continue using *napalm-logs*.

The Docker image built and published on the Docker Hub, 
https://hub.docker.com/r/napalmautomation/napalm-logs is now based on Debian 
Buster and Python 3.9.

New features
------------

Added two new optional configuration bits for :ref:`device-profiles`, namely 
``state`` and ``state_tag``, that are helpful to process and flag appropriately 
messages that have a counter-part, e.g., ``MAJOR_ALARM_CLEARED`` 
/ ``MAJOR_ALARM_SET``.

Enabled support for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Simply by adding the Sentry 
DSN under the ``sentry_dsn`` configuration key, or as the ``SENTRY_DSN`` 
environment variable, *napalm-logs* will send error traces to your Sentry 
server. See :ref:`configuration-options-sentry-dsn` for more details.

New Structured Messages
-----------------------

The following have been added for Junos:

- :ref:`INTERFACE_UP`
- :ref:`FAILED_ALLOCATING_PACKET_BUFFER`
