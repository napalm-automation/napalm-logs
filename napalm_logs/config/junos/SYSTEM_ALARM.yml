# This error tag corresponds to syslog messages notifying that there has been a
# change in status for an alarm.
# There are multiple entries for this error. The reason being that the exact
# component name can be contained in the reason section, so has to be extracted
# via a specific regex.
messages:
  # 'error' should be unique and vendor agnostic. Currently we are using the JUNOS syslog message name as the canonical name.
  # This may change if we are able to find a more well defined naming system.
